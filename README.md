# Foundations Choreography

UCLA's Foundations Choreography is an organization meant to create a safe space for beginner/intermediate dancers to grow, train, and challenge themselves! The <a href="https://fcricepurity.github.io/">FC Purity Test</a> serves to catalogue the UCLA Foundations experience. It is an opportunity for dancers to bond over shared experiences and see how Foundations Choreography has become embedded in their lives.

# Technology of Website

The site was made as a React app and uses bootstrap 5 to assist with CSS styling. The site is designed entirely with functional components and React hooks for their performance and readability. Using a mobile-first approach, we use a combination of bootstrap and our own CSS to make the site as responsive as possible to most screen-sizes. Trt it out on both desktop and mobile! We initially designed the site <a href="https://github.com/FCRicePurity/FCRicePurity.github.io-deprecated-">without React</a> using just bootstrap and pure HTML and CSS. However, as we continued to evolve the site and implement/change its features, we refactored it into a React application to improve maintainability. (Adding a class to 100 hard-coded li's is not the play). We hope to continue updating the site with new features so stay tuned!

# Want to Run it Yourself?

The site is hosted using github pages at https://fcricepurity.github.io/. However, if you want to fiddle with the code yourself, clone the repository and make sure you have any of the latest stable versions of node, npm, and react on a (preferably) Unix distribution. Within the repository, simply open developer mode with `$ npm start` and get coding with your local version of the FC Purity Test! Note that the FC Purity test was made in a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install">WSL 2.0</a> environment but any unix distribution should suffice.
